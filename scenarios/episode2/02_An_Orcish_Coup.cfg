            story= _ "With the passing of Lord Kapou’e — once hailed as the greatest among them — the glory of the orcs began to wither, torn apart by strife among their remaining leaders. As humans and elves reclaimed their lost power, and treacherous allies turned against them, the relentless assaults of the undead from the north further plunged orcish society into chaos."

            story= _ "Years later, four orcish chieftains rose to vie for supremacy over their fractured people. Among them was Lord Kogran, who harbored disdain for the old capital and its traditions, yet sought to establish an ironclad rule through sheer strength. A civil war erupted, though it concluded far sooner than any had anticipated. Of the three surviving leaders, two secured their positions by groveling before Kogran."

            story= _ "Now, having forged an unholy alliance with the damned, Tanar pressed onward toward the stronghold of his nemesis, Kogran. Meanwhile, Gwiti, confident in the strength he had amassed, resolved to make this raid the final prelude to his ultimate conquest of the continent. In his mind, there was no question: soon, Wesnoth and its allies would be consigned to the Land of the Dead by his own hand."
