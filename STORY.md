Brief Overview
--------------

Below is the timeline written by shadowm for The Dark Hordes, and this campaign follows essentially the same:

> **1094 YW**
> 
> * Orcish civil war ensues among the tribes near Glamdrol.
> * A Great Chief arises amongst the orcs.
> 
> **1095 YW**
> 
> * Orcs attack the fortress of Erzen - a battle ensues.
> * Brothers Gwiti and Nati Ha'atel use their magic skills to raise former enemies and deceased allies for help on the battle-field. The result is catastrophic for their side, and the battle is lost.
> * Gwiti and Nati are banished from the continent. **The Dark Hordes I** begins.
> 
> **1096 YW**
> 
> * Gwiti Ha'atel takes over the Tower of Kaleon searching for the Tome of Crelanu.
> 
> **1097 YW**
> 
> * Gwiti Ha'atel finds Crelanu's book.
> * Gwiti Ha'atel withdraws to the mountains, fleeing from Lord Aretu's army. **The Dark Hordes I** ends.
> 
> **1099 YW**
> 
> * Gwiti Ha'atel launches a surprise attack on Wesnoth. The headquarters of the Council of Archmagi are completely destroyed and everyone inside is slain.
> * Elynia is called upon by the remaining members of the Council of Archmagi to pursue and defeat the necromancer.
> * Elynia confronts the necromancer but she is fatally injured. Gwiti leaves the battlefield assuming her dead.
> * **Argan**, an outsider of unknown origins with an advanced knowledge of dark magic, finds Elynia and saves her from certain death.
> 
> **1100 YW**
> 
> * Elynia finds Gwiti Ha'atel again in the Estmarks, and takes on him for the second and last time.
> * Elynia uses the power of Light for the first time to win the battle, and defeat Gwiti, who casts a curse upon her with his final words. Eye-witnesses would spread the word about the events of that day, referring to the elf as the "Lady of Light".

And the following sentence is old material from the Invasion from the Unknown campaign:

> By 1099 YW, the necromancer Gwiti Ha'atel launches a surprise attack to the headquarters of the Council of Archmagi of Wesnoth, and kills the leader of the Council, using powers apparently obtained from the Tome of Crelanu.
> 
> Knowing that the Tome contained forbidden secrets that should not be learned by evil forces such as the undead, the remaining members of the Council call upon Elynia, by then known as a powerful elven shyde that either helped or defeated foes alone foes in many oportunities, to pursue Ha'atel and defeat him.
> 
> When she confronts him, however, the necromancer proves to have the advantage, due to the techniques he learned from the Book. Elynia is mortally injured, and the Necromancer abandons the battlefield having thought she would die for sure. Mistake.
> 
> An unknown man finds her, and virtually restores parts of her body with magic completely unknown to her. He identifies himself as Argan, a wayfarer who came from "lands above the skies" searching for knowledge. Elynia notices that Argan has the power of darkness, and knows that albeit his good intentions, she should stay away from him, as such powers may damage and corrupt her soul. Argan gives her an artifact, a "Thunderstone", which "gives good luck".
> 
> Elynia confronts the necromancer again, who has gathered yet more power by the time being. However, this time she is not alone as Lord Aretu, leading the Wesnothian army, and an orcish tribe under the banner of the Northern Alliance are fighting Gwiti, cornered at Estmark Hills.
> 
> * Gwiti Ha'atel: You back? I- didn't I...
> * Elynia: Necromancer, your deeds against the Kingdom of Wesnoth will not go unpunished. I have returned to make sure, personally, that you never dare disturb the dead or the living again!
> * Gwiti Ha'atel: And what will you do... kill me? You sure are a good comedian!
> * Gwiti Ha'atel: Listen elf, I cannot help but wonder what is your bussiness with the human kingdom... nonetheless, I'll not commit the same mistake I did when I let you abandoned in agony; this time nothing will save you.
> * Elynia: Perhaps. We'll see. Anyway, one of us will fall.
> * Gwiti Ha'atel: And the other will live forever... and I'm going to make sure that so it will be.
> 
> During the last fight, as she faces alone the power of the undead and is almost outpowered by them, the stone gives her energy and she discovers that she can call upon the powers of Light directly.
> 
> As she defeats Gwiti Ha'atel, the necromancer speaks:
> 
> * Gwiti Ha'atel: I fall. As I said, I'm making sure... that the other will live forever. I curse you to see your efforts be destroyed by the pass of time. I curse you to see the world dry up and die. You will see how each of your beloved ones passes away with great pain, and you will want to have never messed with me.
> * Gwiti Ha'atel: At the end, the pain of the loss will give you an eternity of agony.... haha... ha...
> 
> Elynia would live forever until the world dried up and no more creatures would inhabit it. Until that would occur, she'd see her beloved ones either turn against her, or perish in tragic manners.
> 
> An unexpected consequence of the curse and death of the necromancer was that she gained the power of necromancy, which she had secretly put in practice ever since.
> 
> From that time, to later, Elynia is known by Elves and Humans as the Lady of Light, and by Dwarves and Orcs and the Source of Light.

This idea made by shadowm is very helpful to me and already some of the curse of Gwiti has been written into **E1S0** with an arrangement. My ideal goal, however, is to make these ideas by shadowm compatible in the natural way with the ending by the original author.

To this end, I have come up with the following additional elements and ideas:

1. The artifact Skull of Morgorath (the product of an alternate world to Irdya and once the Demon Lord) and Leganoth are set up as the final enemies of the protagonist; Gwiti is indeed defeated once by Elynia, but he is transported by the power of Leganoth (to be exact; the power of the one half of the Skull of Morgorath is also included) to another space away from the Earth. There is the cave-like space where the other half of the Skull of Morgorath is located. This battle will be the final scenario, tracing almost exactly how the original ending unfolded.

2. In order to realize the above ideas, I will emphasize foreshadowing, especially within **E1S4**. It is stretched in the form of lore already written in the monoliths. For example, that Morgorath was once the monarch who ruled over the living and was executed by the Gods of Light and Darkness for his arrogance.

For more detailed settings regarding Morgorath/Leganoth, please see <ins>Character Settings</ins> below.

These should and probably can be compatible with the Project-Ethea settings. However, my knowledge of the lore is somewhat lacking, so future checks and reviews may reveal problems. In that case, changing the tone significantly is not an issue.

Also, as note, I am *not* entirely unquestioning of this plot by shadowm; I think the appearance of Lord Aretu is unnecessary when Elynia and Gwiti fight again. Also, Arkal-Thil, the character from future history, is treated as the disciple of Gwiti (who eventually betrays him and takes the Book of Crelanu from him), which was an idea by me and Roge.

Character Settings
------------------

Gwiti Ha'atel
-------------

As with the characterization of The Dark Hordes, he is an evil necromancer. Unlike ordinary necromancers, however, he gained his mighty power phenomenally quickly by completing rituals with his brother on the battlefield and offering his own soul; even when the Wesnothians nearly killed him, the power of the Gwiti never completely disappeared. The character for Gwiti is portrayed as somewhat shortsighted, and his brother Nati Ha'atel needs to be more rational.

Gwiti pursues two artifacts, the Skull of Morgorath and the Book of Crelanu, for his own revenge and to increase his power, the former ultimately calling for his own destruction (or the new rebirth at the last minute).

As for Elynia, Gwiti is somewhat sympathetic and condescending attitude, and is also unknowingly wary of the unknowable power that lies within her.

Morgorath/Leganoth
------------------

**Warning: these settings still need to be elaborated. There are probably inconsistencies to pursue.**

He was one of the Demon Monarchs, creatures created by an alternate world to Irdya. The demons ruled over all living beings in Irdya in prehistoric times, but their arrogance incurred the wrath of the Gods and they were largely banished by the Darkness and the Light. Their leader, Morgorath, was killed by the soldiers of the gods, and his very existence was regarded as hostile and was to be buried forever.

The body of Morgorath was dismembered into pieces and each sealed into magical spaces. This suggests the same circumstances as Yanqui/Zhangor. However, he split his consciousness into three parts before the magic was completely extinguished from him. Two of these remained where the brain of Morgorath had been, i.e. in both halves of the skull. And the remaining one, given the name Leganoth, remained secretly within Irdya.

When the three merged again, the consciousness of Morgorath should be fully restored. For Leganoth, however, the problem lay elsewhere. His physical body was already decomposed and weathered, or useless because the seal was stored in solid places. He therefore sought an appropriate powerful being to serve as the dependent of his consciousness.

He then contacted Gwiti, who deceived him in the natural way.

Leganoth led Gwiti to test him, using monoliths as touchstones to him; Gwiti succeeded in them and recovered the one half of the skull, so Leganoth considered him passable. His only miscalculation was that Gwiti did not listen to him until the end and adopted hostile attitude. His plans were therefore behind schedule and Gwiti headed off in search of the Book of Crelanu.

**The detailed structure of the scenario is currently being written, but it has been decided that it will be as follows:**

* E1S1: Double Betrayal
* E1S2: A New Chance
* E1S3: Brother Against Brother
* E1S4: The Skull of Morgorath
* E1S5: Mages and Elves
* E1S6: Inside the Tower
* E1S7: The Book of Crelanu
* E1S8: Confrontation
* E1S9: The Dwarven Gates

* E2S1: Return to the Northlands
* E2S2: An Orcish Coup
* E2S3: Assault on Alduin
* E2S4: Fear the Unliving
* E2S5: A Fated Clash
* E2S6: The Crown Prince
* E2S7: At the End of Blood
* E2S8: Revelations
* E2S9: Showdown in the Shadows

Finally, thank you for reading this document. It is still in the process of being written and is very subject to change.
