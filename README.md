The Shadow Returns
==================

**The Shadow Returns** (**TSR**) is an add-on campaign for the **[Battle for Wesnoth][1]**.

Description
-----------

This is the story of an age when the glory of Wesnoth had become but a memory of days long past. The fugitive necromancer Gwiti Ha’atel is determined to master the undead hordes and exact his revenge upon the living. His dark journey unleashes waves of power that gradually engulf all of Irdya...

At last, Gwiti’s evil forces launch their assault against Wesnoth. As the mortals under his command plunge the kingdom and its people into darkness, they turn to their final hope: the elven enchantress Elynia. Thus begins the ultimate confrontation between light and darkness.

**(Expert level, 9 scenarios of 18 completed.)**

This is my beta release of the revised version of The Dark Hordes. TDH is the oldest UMC for Wesnoth and was once the mainline campaign; it has long been abandoned as unfinished.

Wesnoth 1.18.0 or later required.
