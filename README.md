Descriptions
------------

This is the story of an age when the glory of Wesnoth was becoming memories of the former days. The fugitive necromancer Gwiti Haâ€™atel is resolved to master the undead hordes and take revenge against the people. His journey gradually leaves his powers in great waves that engulf all of Irdya...

Finally, the evil forces of Gwiti launch an attack against Wesnoth. Even as the mortals under his command consign the kingdom and their followers to the shadows, the people turn to one last hope: the elven enchantress Elynia. And the confrontation between light and darkness reaches their fateful ending.

**(Expert level, only first episode with 5 scenarios of 9 completed.)**
